`black` keeps python code up to a standard format.

`fire` My preferred command line tool 
`click` Command line tool

`pylint` disable extra verbose test because I only care about warning and error messages. 

`pytest` Give me some verbose output and run test code script for my coverage.

`textblob` simple nlp processing 

Run `black` to test code format 

Add python libraries 

```shell
make install 

python -m textblob.download_corpora
```

```sh
#format code
black *.py mylib/*.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
6 files left unchanged.
```

Run `lint` to test for bad code 

```sh 
Your code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, +0.00)

```
